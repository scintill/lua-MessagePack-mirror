lua-MessagePack : a pure Lua implementation (spec v5)
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization format.

It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON but it's faster and smaller.

It's a pure Lua implementation, without dependency.

And it's really fast with [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org).
